HW 7 due Tuesday, October 22

//////////////////////////

Today:
- Finish proof tactics
- Prove DeMorgan's laws for quantifiers
- Soundness and completeness issues
- Begin mathematical induction

//////////////////////////

Proof tactics for predicate logic

- see if you can do anything right away with the premises
    Which rules? AndE, ImplyE, AllE, ExistsI

- look at top-level operator for what you are trying to prove
    trying to prove a "for all" statement with ∀?
        subproof with let, introduce random individual
            try to prove our goal about that random individual
        (AllI)

    trying to prove a "there exists" statement with ∃?
        need to show it's true for one
        do I have that statement about a particular individual?

        could I use AllE about a particular individual with
            an all statement?

        do I have a "there exists" statement as a premise?
            try ExistsE on that premise to get your conclusion

        really can't find anything? try PbC

<--- stopped here, will continue Thursday

    trying to prove an implies?


    trying to prove ¬(something)


    trying to prove an OR


    trying to prove an AND


    what should you do when you open a subproof?




Unsure what to do?




/////////////////////////////////////////

Proving DeMorgan's laws

//demorgan1.sc
∀ x ¬P(x)       equivalent to       ¬(∃ x P(x))

/////////////////////////////////////

//demorgan2.sc
∃ x ¬P(x)       equivalent to       ¬(∀ x P(x))

////////////////////////////////////////

Soundness and completeness of predicate logic.


Soundness: definition?

    propositional:

    predicate logic:




Completeness: definition?

    propositional:

    predicate logic:



///////////////////////////////////

Same argument might be VALID in one domain and INVALID in another

- deduction can only prove arguments that are valid in ANY domain
- we can't prove all valid arguments


Domain with integers with operations like +


All integers? 2 + 3 = ?


Subset (0,1,2,3,4) of integers. 2 + 3 = ?



////////////////////////////////////


Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.

Any consistent formal system where integer arithmetic is
carried out is incomplete -- there will be true statements
that cannot be proved.

(depends on interpretations)

//////////////////////////////////

Mathematical induction.

Tool for proving something involving natural numbers
    1 and up

Base case: prove the statement is true for the first element in
    our domain.

Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for some k in
    our domain. Given that, prove the statement is true for k+1.

--> how will this prove the statement for our entire domain?


** the process of proving the correctness of loops is similar **



/////////////////////////////////

Example:

We want to prove that for any positive integer n:

    1 + 2 + ... + n = n*(n+1)/2


Try it out first.
    n = 1?
    n = 2?
    n = 3?


Let P(n) be the claim that...?

LHS(n) = ?
RHS(n) = ?

So to show P(n) holds, we can show that...?



///

Proof by induction.


Base case:

Inductive step:



/////////////////////////////////

Do you think induction can be used to prove properties for
    ALL integers?



/////////////////////////////////

Example: Prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2.

    (what is our domain?)


Let P(n) be the claim that... ?

LHS(n) = 1 + 3 + ... + (nth odd number?)
RHS(n) = n^2



Proof by induction.


/////////////////////////////////

Example: 3^n - 1 is even for all positive integers n.

Let P(n) be the claim ???


n = 3?


what does "even" mean?
