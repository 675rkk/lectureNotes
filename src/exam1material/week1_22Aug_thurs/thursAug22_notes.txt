////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Today:

- Begin logic gates and truth tables


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Lion always lies on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
Lion always tells the truth on other days.
Unicorn always lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays,
    and always tells the truth on other days.

On Sunday, everyone tells the truth.

Lion says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days."
Unicorn says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days, too."

What day is it?








/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Tweedledee and Tweedledum are identical.
You know that one of them lies Mon/Tues/Wed,
and that the other lies Thurs/Fri/Sat.
(They tell the truth on non-lying days.)

You donâ€™t know which is which.

You see both of them together.


First twin: Today is Monday or Wednesday
Second twin: Today is Monday or Sunday

What day of the week is it?

(what kind of OR?)



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You know that either Tweedledum or Tweedledee has
    lost a rattle.

You find the rattle and want to return it.

It isn't Sunday.




The first one says: "Tweedledee owns the rattle."

The second one says: "I'm Tweedledee!"

--> Who gets the rattle?
